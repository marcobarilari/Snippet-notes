To analyse one or more files:

```bash
mh_style my_file.m
```

It is possible to also style-check and fix code embedded inside SimulinkÂ® models. To do you need to use a special command-line flag. Once the feature is stable enough, this flag will be removed.

```bash
mh_style --fix initEnv.m
```

To analyse all files in a directory tree:
```bash
mh_style src/
```
